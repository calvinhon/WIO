# üî¨ Enable spaCy for Advanced NLP Analysis

## Quick Setup (Optional)

Your Flutter app already works great with **Dart NLP** (default mode). But if you want **professional-grade ML analysis**, you can enable spaCy:

### 1. **Install Python on Android** (Advanced Users)
```bash
# This requires a rooted device or special setup
# Most users should skip this and use Dart NLP instead

# Example for devices with Python support:
pip3 install spacy
python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### 2. **Toggle spaCy Mode**
In your app, tap the **brain icon** (üß†) in the analysis screen to switch between:
- **Code icon** = Dart NLP (default, always works)
- **Brain icon** = spaCy ML (requires Python setup)

### 3. **What spaCy Adds:**
- **Advanced entity recognition** (PERSON, ORG, GPE, MONEY, DATE, TIME)
- **Part-of-speech tagging**
- **Dependency parsing**
- **Language detection**
- **Lemmatization** (word root forms)
- **More accurate sentiment analysis**

### 4. **Fallback Behavior:**
If spaCy fails, the app **automatically falls back** to Dart NLP, so you'll never lose functionality.

## üéØ **Recommendation:**

**For most users**: Stick with **Dart NLP** (default) - it's fast, reliable, and provides excellent analysis without any setup.

**For developers/researchers**: Try spaCy integration if you need maximum accuracy and have a Python-enabled environment.
